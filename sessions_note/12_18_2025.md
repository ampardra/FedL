# Session Note 2

## Paper-Specific Ideas and Observations

### FedLoRU
1. Explore combining the method with **model averaging**.
2. Investigate making the selected ranks **adaptive** rather than fixed.

### FlexLoRA
1. Open question: **What are the adaptive ranks conditioned on?** (e.g., data distribution, client characteristics).
2. Consider alternative techniques to **SVD decomposition** for rank selection or adaptation.

### FSLoRA
1. Explore making the **S filters adaptive** instead of static.

### CE-LoRA
1. Privacy concern: **Client data is used to compute similarity**—how does this impact privacy guarantees in Federated Learning?

## General Research Directions

1. What other **variants or extensions of LoRA** exist or can be proposed?
2. Design and analyze **attack models targeting LoRA** in Federated Learning settings.

## Tasks

- [ ] Create a GitHub repository to organize all notes and papers.
- [ ] Compile a list of ideas and conduct a brainstorming session to shortlist candidates for the next meeting.
